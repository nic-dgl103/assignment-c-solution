    <h1>Our Services</h1>
    <p>Below is a list of services we proudly offer.</p>
    <p>At Hairpins, we care about the environment and recognize the impact we all have on it. We are continually making
      strides to reduce where we can and have only aligned ourselves with companies and products we believe in. We are
      proud to be a CERTIFIED GREEN CIRCLE SALON and through that partnership are able to divert 95% of our salon waste
      from landfills. Get in touch if you have any questions or want to learn more about the programs and charities we
      are focusing our efforts on.</p>
